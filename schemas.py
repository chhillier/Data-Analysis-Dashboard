"""
Explanation of Code:

This file (`schemas.py`) is basically about defining the 'shape' of the data 
our API expects to receive and the 'shape' of the data it will send back. 
We use something called Pydantic models here â€“ you can think of them as clear 
templates or 'blueprints' for our data. Our FastAPI web framework uses these 
Pydantic blueprints to automatically:
1.  Check incoming data: It makes sure any data sent to our API is correct 
    (e.g., has the right data types like numbers or text, and includes all 
    the necessary pieces of information).
2.  Handle data conversion: It smoothly changes our data between Python's way 
    of thinking and JSON (which is how data is usually sent over the web).
3.  Create API documentation: It builds helpful 'how-to-use' guides for our API 
    automatically, so it's clear what data to send and what you'll get back.

Sometimes, just knowing a piece of data is a number or text isn't enough. 
That's where `Field` (which we get from Pydantic) helps out. `Field` lets us 
add extra details to our data blueprints. For example, we can use it to write a 
description of what a data field means, show some examples of what it should look 
like, or even set specific rules (like 'this number must be between 1 and 100'). 
This makes our API more reliable and use correctly.
